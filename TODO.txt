Keyboard Settings:
0) Implement emulator "pause/play" feature.
1) Remove any key mappings that have more than 2 keys per scancode
2) Create window with tableview
3) Create keyboard mappings getter in keyboard/emulatorcore
4) Create array that conerts scancode numbers into Ascii ('a', 'CTRL+M', etc.)
5) Under the tableview, have a small area that lets you change the key and
   and alternate keys. This will be a label ("Key/Alternate Key"), textbox
   (with the text of the current key-combo), and a "Change" button. When you
   click the Change button, the text on the button changes to "Revert", and the
   textbox says "Press a key combination...". This loops on a variable that will
   get set in the KeyReleased event (while keycombo == Key::Unknown).
6) When the "OK" button gets clicked, apply these settings to the emulator (the
   settings dialog has a reference to the EmulatorCore).

Make sure escape doesn't cause the dialog to escape (since escape is a valid key
you can map to):
