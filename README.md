# SuperII
A cross-platform Apple II+ emulator built for my Software Engineering senior capstone project at the Oregon Institute of Tecnhnology. This was implemented using the QT Framework.

This emulator fully emulates many key aspects of an Apple II+:
 - 6502 CPU
 - Address Decoding/System Bus
 - Keyboard
 - Speaker
 - All graphic modes
 - Language Card (extra 16KB of bank switched RAM)
 - Floppy Disk Controller and Drive

This emulator is functional enough to play popular Apple II games like The Oregon Trail (among others).

Beyond the core emulation features, the GUI also features a diassembly window, memory viewer, and CPU register viewer for help with debugging homebrew applications.
